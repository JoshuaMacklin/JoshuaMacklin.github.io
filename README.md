**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript

My current layout has my branding at the top, scrolling down you'll get a personal about me section, followed by an embded Video Introduction to myself. 3 of my latest projects, a few testimonials and then finishing off with a contact me area.

I also created a dark mode version that once switched to dark mode, is saved into the browser cache so once you return to the website, your Light/Dark mode preference is saved!
